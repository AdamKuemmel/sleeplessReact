# ![N/A sheild](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-N%2FA-red) ReactSleepless

## Description

This project represents the Sleepless tester homepage. Different from the native test, this one was built using react. The navbar and Team scroller both had to be changed because of the use of jQuery. The navbar feature will render a different component based on what size viewport you LOAD the page on so chrome dev tools will not work to show hamburger animations unless the page is loaded with a smaller viewport(hit refresh while in desired viewport, should do it). All features and code were written by Adam Kuemmel and no bootstrap was used. Some key features include:

```
  WHEN the user scrolls
  THEN the navbar move to top of screen and logos disapear for a better UX
  WHEN the user scrolls
  THEN the background image moves slower then the rest of the components
  WHEN the user is on mobile or tablet
  THEN the layout is completely responsive
  WHEN the user swipes the group of team cards
  THEN the cards move with the swipe
  WHEN the user scrolls over any button or anchor tag
  THEN a hover psuedo class is invoked

```
